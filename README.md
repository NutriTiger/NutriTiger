### Branching Guidelines
The general branch structure is as follows.
- ``main``
- ``prototype``
- ``alpha``
- ``beta``

Then, for stretch goals and other features, use the feature syntax
Ex: ``feature/webscraping``

Branching Commands:

Change to branch:
- ``git checkout feature/abc`` (equivalent to ``git branch feature/abc``)

Make edits/commit/push accordingly to your branch freely.

When you are ready to merge with prototype, or whatever master branch
- ``git checkout prototype``
- ``git merge feature/abc``
- Resolve any merge conflicts (can do visually)
- Commit changes ``git commit -m "Merging abc with prototype"``
- ``git push origin prototype`` (origin is the configured remote name)


Miscellaneous Commands
``python â€“m pip freeze > requirements.txt``
